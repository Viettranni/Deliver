# Food Ordering App
This repository houses a dynamic Food Ordering App built with HTML/Bootstrap for the front end and Python Django for the back end. The application is divided into two main functionalities:

# Customer App
Designed for end-users, the Customer App allows individuals to seamlessly browse through available food options, place orders, and interact with the ordering process. The user-friendly interface, powered by HTML and Bootstrap, ensures an intuitive experience for customers.

# Restaurant Staff App
This app caters specifically to restaurant staff, providing them with the tools needed to manage and process incoming orders efficiently. Staff members can manipulate and update the menu, track orders, and ensure a smooth workflow within the restaurant.

By combining the power of Django's backend capabilities with a responsive front end, this Food Ordering App delivers a comprehensive solution for both customers and restaurant staff, facilitating a streamlined and enjoyable food ordering experience.
